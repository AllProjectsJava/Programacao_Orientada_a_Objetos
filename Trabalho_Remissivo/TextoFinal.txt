37 PREFACE.

40 The great progress which the art of perfumery has made during recent
41 times is due to several causes, the chief one of which is fully
42 realized only by the manufacturer on a large scale, who stands, as
43 it were, behind the scenes and has access to facts and information
44 concerning the materials he uses, which are not so easily accessible
45 to the dilettante in perfumery, or remain altogether unknown to the
46 latter. This important factor is the advance in our knowledge of the
47 physical and chemical properties of the several substances used in
48 perfumery, whereby we can better discriminate between the genuine
49 and the spurious, the choicest and the inferior, thus insuring, at
50 the very start, a satisfactory result, instead of being compelled to
51 resort to wasteful experimentation and empiricism. A better knowledge
52 has also been gained of the sources of the commercial varieties of
53 many of the crude products, and a better insight into the conditions
54 affecting their qualities or properties. A more exhaustive study of
55 the proximate principles of many of the essential oils has thrown
56 an entirely new light upon this heretofore obscure class of bodies,
57 placing into our hands new products of definite chemical composition,
58 unvarying in physical properties, and many of them valuable additions
59 to the perfumer’s stock of ingredients. Synthetic chemistry has also
60 added to the list of materials required by the perfumer, and is surely
61 going to add many more to it hereafter. Though some of these, like
62 the new artificial musk, are not yet in a condition to enter into
63 serious competition with the natural products, yet it is merely a
64 question of time when the latter need no longer be depended upon. The
65 increasing demands for the staple articles used by the perfumer have
66 also caused a large increase in the cultivation of many important
67 plants in various parts of the world, and have led to the establishment
68 of new plantations, in some cases to such an extent that the commercial
69 relations have been entirely revolutionized, new territories producing
70 larger crops and a finer product than the old home of the plant. The
71 exploration of hitherto unknown or imperfectly known countries has
72 also largely added to the perfumer’s art, and is likely to continue to
73 do this for a long time to come, since it is now well known that vast
74 districts, more particularly in tropical Africa, are inhabited by a
75 flora abounding in new odoriferous plants.
76 
77 In spite of all this expansion of the perfumer’s stock of trade,
78 however, which results in the periodical introduction of new compounds,
79 there is a very large number of popular odorous mixtures which remain
80 in steady demand, having taken such firm root among civilized nations
81 that they are not likely to be displaced. It is more particularly with
82 a view to afford information regarding these latter that a work like
83 the present is desirable and necessary. A treatise on perfumery is
84 expected to place into the hands of the purchaser reasonably reliable
85 processes for preparing the most generally approved simple or compound
86 perfumes, as well as accurate information concerning the origin and
87 properties of the various ingredients, together with practical hints
88 regarding the determination of their genuineness and purity.
89 
90 It is a frequent complaint of those who make preparations after
91 formulas published in works like the present, that they do not
92 succeed in obtaining fully satisfactory products. Another complaint
93 of purchasers of such works is this: that they fail to find formulas
94 yielding preparations identical in every respect with certain
95 celebrated perfumes which have made the reputation and fortune of
96 certain firms. Regarding the first complaint, we would say that
97 the failure lies generally with the complainant himself, through
98 carelessness in the selection of the materials or disregard of
99 the given directions. Concerning the second complaint, a moment’s
100 reflection must convince any one that formulas which are the result
101 of the study and experimentation of years, and the products of which
102 are the main stock of trade of certain firms, are carefully guarded,
103 and not likely to be communicated to others. Moreover, in many cases
104 even a publication of the component parts would not be of much avail,
105 for the manufacturer on the large scale has facilities for blending
106 and seasoning his products which the maker on a small scale does not
107 possess, and it is this part of the art particularly upon which the
108 quality of the products depends.
109 
110 In preparing the present treatise for the American public many changes
111 were found necessary in the original text, in order to make the
112 information given more correct or definite, and so bring the work more
113 abreast of the present time. In addition to various improvements and
114 additions made in the working formulas comprising the second portion of
115 the work, the description of the natural products used as ingredients,
116 upon the quality and selection of which the success of the perfumer
117 mostly depends, has been carefully revised, and so far as the objects
118 of this work required, completed by Dr. Charles Rice, Associate Editor
119 of _American Druggist_, etc., in consultation with several experts in
120 the art of perfumery.

124 CHAPTER I.
125 
126 THE HISTORY OF PERFUMERY.
127 
128 
129 The gratification of his senses is peculiar to man, and it is to this
130 trait that we are indebted for all the arts. The activities which
131 aimed at the gratification of the eye and ear developed into the
132 creative arts and music, and in like manner human endeavor directed
133 toward the stimulation of the sense of smell has in our time assumed
134 the proportions both of an art and a science; for it was nothing but
135 the advancement of chemistry that made it possible to fix all the
136 pleasant odors offered by nature and to create new perfumes by the
137 artistic combination of these scents. The preparation of perfumes is a
138 very ancient art that is met with among all peoples possessed of any
139 degree of civilization. It is particularly the ancient nations of the
140 Orient which had in truth become masters in the manufacture of numerous
141 perfumes.
142 
143 The first perfume was the fragrant flower; it has continued to be so
144 to the present day: the sprig of dried lavender flowers which we lay
145 in the clothes-press was probably used for the same purpose by the
146 contemporaries of Aristotle. In the Orient, which we may look upon as
147 the cradle of the art of perfumery, the idea suggested itself early to
148 substitute for the delicious fragrance of the flowers some substances
149 of lasting odor; various sweet-scented resins supplied the material
150 for this purpose. The use of these aromatic resins must have been
151 very extensive: the ancient Egyptians alone consumed extraordinary
152 quantities for embalming their dead. How highly the Oriental peoples
153 in general prized perfumes can be learned from the Bible: the Jews
154 (like the Catholics to the present day) employed an aromatic gum-resin
155 (olibanum, frankincense) in their religious ceremonies; in the Song of
156 Solomon mention is made of Indian perfumes, for instance, cinnamon,
157 spikenard, myrrh, and aloes.
158 
159 Altogether, incense played a prominent part in the religious ceremonies
160 of the ancient Western Asiatic nations—among many peoples under a
161 theocratic government it was even believed to be sinful to use incense
162 for other than religious purposes. The Bible teaches us that Ezekiel
163 and Isaiah protested against it, and that Moses even prescribed the
164 preparation of certain kinds of incense for use in the tabernacle.
165 
166 Among the most highly civilized people of antiquity, the Greeks, a
167 large number of fragrant substances, as well as oils perfumed with
168 them—that is to say, perfumes in the same sense as we still understand
169 the term—was known; this will be no surprise to those familiar with the
170 culture of this remarkable people. The odor of violets was the favorite
171 among the Greeks; besides this they used the scent of the different
172 mints, thyme, marjoram, and other aromatic plants. This was carried
173 so far as to become a matter of fashion for the Greek fop to use only
174 certain odors in the form of ointments for the hair, others for the
175 neck, etc. In order to prevent this luxury which was carried to such
176 an excess, Solon even promulgated a law that interdicted the sale of
177 fragrant oils to Athenian men (the law did not apply to the women).
178 
179 The Romans, who were the pupils of the Greeks in all the arts, carried
180 the luxury with perfumes perhaps even farther. In ancient Rome there
181 was a very numerous guild of perfumers called _unguentarii_; they
182 are said to have had a street to themselves in Capua. A Patrician
183 Roman anointed himself three times daily with precious, sweet-scented
184 oils which he personally took along into his bath in golden vessels
185 of exquisite workmanship, so-called nartheciæ. At the funeral of
186 his wife Poppæa, Nero is said to have used as incense more odorous
187 substances than could be produced in one year in Arabia, at that time
188 the only reputed source of perfumes. This luxury went so far that
189 during the games in the open amphitheatres the whole air was filled
190 with sweet odors ascending from numerous censers arranged in a circle.
191 The apartments of well-to-do Romans always contained large and very
192 valuable urns filled with dried blossoms, to keep the air permanently
193 perfumed.
194 
195 Roman extravagance with perfumes was carried to such an excess that
196 under the consulate of Licinius Crassus a law was passed which
197 restricted the use of perfumery, there being good reason to fear that
198 there would not be enough for the ceremonies in the temples.
199 
200 With the migration of the almost savage Huns and Goths, the refinement
201 of morals ceased, progress in civilization was retarded for centuries,
202 and at the same time the use of perfumes disappeared entirely in
203 Europe; but it was otherwise in the Orient. As an instance we may
204 mention the prophecy of Mohammed, who promised in the Koran to the
205 faithful in paradise the possession of black-eyed houries whose bodies
206 were composed of the purest musk.
207 
208 The Arabs, the ancient masters of chemistry, were also the first
209 founders of the art of perfumery. Thus the Arabian physician Avicenna,
210 in the tenth century, taught the art of preparing fragrant waters from
211 leaves, and Sultan Saladin, in 1157, on his triumphal entry, had the
212 walls of the mosque of Omar washed with rose water.
213 
214 It was the intercourse with the Orient brought about by the Crusades
215 that made Europeans again more familiar with the art of perfumery, and
216 a number of new odors rapidly became known. Italy and France, in those
217 times the representatives of culture, were the countries in which the
218 preparation of perfumes was carried on on a large scale. Thus, for
219 instance, we find the name of a Roman family preserved to the present
220 day because one of its members had combined a sweet-scented powder,
221 called Frangipanni after its inventor, which is still in favor, and
222 because his grandson Mauritius Frangipanni had made the important
223 discovery that by treating this powder with spirit of wine the fragrant
224 substance could be obtained in a fluid form.
225 
226 The fact has been frequently related and repeated, that Catherine de
227 Medici, the wife of Henry II., had made use of the fashion of perfuming
228 the body for the purpose of ridding herself of objectionable persons,
229 by giving them scented gloves prepared and at the same time poisoned by
230 a Florentine named René (Renato?). We think this tale to be simply a
231 hair-raising fable—modern chemistry knows no substance the mere touch
232 of which could produce the effect of a fatal poison; and it is scarcely
233 credible that such a material had been known at that time and lost
234 sight of since.
235 
236 In the sixteenth century, especially at the court of Queen Elizabeth,
237 perfumes were used with great extravagance; in fact, were looked upon
238 as one of the necessaries of life. This luxury was carried still
239 farther at the courts of the sumptuous kings of France; Louis XV. went
240 so far as to demand every day a different odor for his apartments. A
241 lady’s lover always used the same kind of perfume she did.
242 
243 It is well known that among the Oriental nations perfumes are used so
244 largely that even food is flavored with rose water, musk, etc.; and
245 Indian and Chinese goods always possess a peculiar aroma which is so
246 characteristic for certain products that it was considered to be a sign
247 of genuineness; this was the case, for instance, with the patchouly
248 odor which always adheres to Indian shawls.
249 
250 A shawl-maker of Lyons, who had succeeded in perfectly imitating Indian
251 shawls with reference to design and colors, spent a fabulous sum to
252 obtain possession of the plant used by the Indian weavers for perfuming
253 their wares. Despite the great outlay caused by the search for this
254 plant, the manufacturer is said to have done a flourishing business
255 with his “genuine” Indian shawls.
256 
257 In more recent times the great extension of trade to the farthest
258 countries of the globe, and still more the progress of chemistry, have
259 made us familiar with a number of new perfumes. More than two hundred
260 different aromatic substances are now known, and still they are far
261 from being exhausted; every year new odoriferous plants become known,
262 from which the chemist extracts perfumes. By this means, as well as by
263 the enormous employment of perfumes in all grades of society, the art
264 of their preparation has risen to a higher plane; out of empiricism,
265 which alone prevailed a few decades ago, into the domain of the
266 chemical sciences.
267 
268 Since the appearance of the last edition of this book, the art of
269 perfumery has made noteworthy progress both with reference to the
270 knowledge of new aromatic substances and to improvement in the
271 methods of their preparation; by the introduction of glycerin, solid
272 and liquid vaselin, and salicylic acid into perfumery, one of its
273 branches—hygienic cosmetics—has made an important advance.
274 
275 At present it is particularly France and England whose perfumery
276 industry is most extensive and which to some extent rule the markets of
277 the world; southern France and Algiers especially furnish the best raw
278 materials, the finest essential oils for the manufacture of perfumes at
279 the chief centres, Paris and London.
